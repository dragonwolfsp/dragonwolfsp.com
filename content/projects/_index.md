Welcome to the crossroads where ingenuity meets imagination—a realm of Wolves and Wonders. Here, in the heart of the den, you’ll find the creations that shape my journey: tools forged in the fires of innovation and projects that howl with purpose.  

Each endeavor is a testament to the balance I guard, blending the ferocity of the wolf, the pride of the lion, and the unyielding drive of the dragon. These are not just projects; they are pieces of the story I’m weaving, one step closer to the wonders yet to come.  

Explore the paths below and discover the heart of my craft.


{% project(name="Git Syncer", url = "https://github.com/dragonwolfsp/git-cyncer", summary = "Keep a directory in sync with a git repo.") %}
Git Cyncer is a simple bash script designed to help users keep a directory in sync with a Git repository. The usage is straightforward—just run the script with two parameters: the repository directory and the time interval in minutes.

### Example Usage:

```bash
./git-cyncer.sh /home/james-bond/git/git-cyncer 2
```

This command tells the script to update the git-cyncer directory every 2 minutes.

Note: You must clone the repository you wish to sync before using the script.
