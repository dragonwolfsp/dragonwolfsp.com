# Welcome

Greetings, wanderer. Thank-you for flying all the way from the <span id="weatherKeyWord"></span> land of <span id="location"></span>. You've found yourself at the den of the Dragonwolf of the Shadow Pride. This is where my worlds converge. It is a space to explore my creations, discover my musings, and perhaps catch a glimpse of the fire and shadows that drive me forward.  

Dive in, and see what I'm working on. Whether it's crafting software, composing music, or building bridges between ideas, there's always something unfolding here.  

<div id="moonFraze">
There is something to be sed about your moon, but unfortunately its mystery has gotten the better of me for the moment.
</div>
<div id="temperatureFraze">
The air around you is far too mysterious for even me  to quantify.
</div>
