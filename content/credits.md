Behind every great creation lies a network of support, inspiration, and tools. This page is dedicated to those who helped make this website—and my journey—possible.  

## Special Thanks  

### 🛡️ Cloudflare  
First and foremost, my gratitude goes to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) for the domain that brought you here. Without their services, dragonwolfsp.com wouldn't exist, and you'd be stuck typing something cryptic like `192.32.47.4` just to visit this site. Thank you, Cloudflare, for making this dream a reality.  

### 🐤 DuckDNS  
A shout-out to [DuckDNS](https://duckdns.org), my original domain host, for providing me with the domain blind-electron.duckdns.org. This humble subdomain kept my website alive and well before I transitioned to Cloudflare. Thank you for being a reliable stepping stone on this journey.  

### 🐧 Daniel Nash and Patrick Wilson  
A heartfelt thank-you to [Daniel Nash](https://nashcentral.duckdns.org) and [Patrick Wilson](https://braillescreen.net) for guiding me through the depths of Linux. Your patience and expertise were invaluable as I found my footing in the world of open-source and command lines.  

### 🌊 Zola and Speyll  
To the creators of [Zola](https://getzola.org), the incredible static site generator powering this website—thank you for making site-building such an enjoyable process.  
A special thanks to **Speyll** for the stunning [Anemone theme](https://github.com/Speyll/anemone) that brought this site to life. Your design expertise is deeply appreciated.
